    "Large language models can be used for various natural language processing tasks, including question-answering (Q&A). These models are trained on a vast amount text data and can generate high-quality responses to a wide range of questions. One thing to note here is that most models have cutoff dates regarding their knowledge, and asking anything too recent might yield an incomplete, imaginative or incorrect answer (i.e. a hallucination).\n",
